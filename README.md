# Initial IOC Configuration

The Nucleo board default IOC configuration include:

* USB_OTG_FS
  * Speed: Device, Full Speed
  * Low power: Disabled
  * Link power management: Disabled
  * VBUS sensing: Enabled
  * Signal start of frame: Enabled
  * Mode: Device_Only
  * USB On The Go FS global interrupt: *disabled*
  * PA8: USB_SOF [TP1]
  * PA9: USB_VBUS
  * PA11-12: USB Data Â±
* Middleware
  * Default: NONE

Make sure this builds and pushes using Segger J-Link.
(It does.)


# Initial Software Configuration and Test

First, we prove the USB port on the Nucleo board
works fine with known good code as provided by
default by the USB Middleware.

Update IOC for `USB_DEVICE` Middleware:
* FS IP: Human Interface Device Class (HID)
* Generate code
* Build, push to device

Confirm it shows up in [USBView](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/debugger/usbview#where-to-get-usbview):

```

Now, add code to prove that the device works:
Move the cursor +1 X pixel every quarter of
a second or so.

Build and push. It works.

Note that when you push and hold the `RESET` button on the Nucleo,
the board de-registers from USB. If you just tap it, it will
deregister and re-register quicly.


# Converting to USB MIDI Device

Now, we will follow the instructions in the
[STM32 MIDI Box](https://github.com/Hypnotriod/midi-box-stm32)
project to modify the USB device implementation to be
a MIDI device.


# Open Questions

* How do we know when we can submit a new IN packet for USB transfer?
  * How do we know when the current IN packet is acknowledged & delivered?
  * How do we know when the current IN packet is requested?
  * Is there an atomic mechanism to replace the current IN packet with a
    different one, prior to it being picked up?
  * Is there a way to cancel a previously scheduled IN packet before it
    is sent (or started to be sent)?
